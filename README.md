## About
This repository is intended for my learning with the Kotlin language, as well as exercising the use of the language.

## Motivation
As my career in technology and my experience progressed, I adapted to what companies were asking for vacancies and over time, I realized that I wasn't doing 100% of what I liked. From this, I started looking for what brought me the most interest and curiosity, starting my studies with the Kotlin language, and later immersing myself in the mobile application ecosystem, firstly with Android and then the iOS ecosystem.

## Topics
The topics covered in this project are the basic concepts of the language, such as syntax, variables, loops, ranges, maps, lists, sets, functions and the entire complete structure. These concepts will be used later for use in both back-end and mobile applications.
